# CaseStudy2DDS

This case study examined the employee.csv dataset and allowed us to find some prominent trends including the jobs with the average environment satisfaction, the highest average job satisfaction, and the highest number of years at the company. We also built a naive bayes classifier using all variables in our dataset to classify attrition with very high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. We also predicted yearly salary based on various factors using a linear regression model.
